                            <p>
                               Hi, my name is Jamaal Brown. A self-taught junior software engineer based in 
                               Houston, Texas. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since I was a kid I have always been interested in technology. I graduated from UT Austin with an Electrical and Computer Engineering 
                                degree and started my career in Power Systems Engineering. After deciding that field wasn't a fit for me longterm 
                                I started self-studying full stack software engineering. My love for technology and how it helps us improve drives
                                me as I continue learning software engineering
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I think being able to take a step back and really understand the problem that we're trying to solve is 
                                really important in coming up with viable solution. Currently in my self learning journey I have worked with the main 
                                front end technologies such as html, css, and javascript. My backend experience is solely based in SQL 
                                at the moment. At my current job we use SQL to query an Oracle database quite regularly. 
                                I enjoy figuring out how to solve problems
                                and learning something new which is what gets me excited about working in the software industry
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My favorite things to do in my spare time is cooking, running, gaming, and spending time outdoors. 
                            </p>
