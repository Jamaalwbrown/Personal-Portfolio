                            <p>
                               Hi, my name is Jamaal Brown. A self-taught software engineer based in 
                               Houston, Texas. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I fell in love with technology in the 7th grade in my first 
                                computer class and from there my curiosity for technology began. 
                                I am passionate about coding and I love learning and problem-solving
                                collaboratively in teams.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Being able to take a step back and really understand the problem 
                                I am looking to solve is really important. I enjoy building high quality 
                                applications in JavaScript and React and working with RESTful APIs, Node.js, 
                                and Express.js. I also enjoy using databases like PostgreSQL to store data. 
                                I like being challenged and there is always an opportunity to learn something new 
                                in web development and that is what gets me excited about this industry.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My favorite things to do in my spare time is yoga, gardening, creating
                                beaded jewelry, traveling and spending time with my friends and family
                            </p>
