                            <p>
                               Hi, my name is Jamaal Brown. A self-taught junior software engineer based in 
                               Houston, Texas. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since I was kid I have always been interested in technology. I graduated from the Electrical and Computer Engineering 
                                curriculum at UT Austin. I started my career in Power Systems but after deciding that field wasn't for me 
                                I started learning full stack software engineering on my own. My love for technology and how it helps us improve drives
                                me to continue learning software in my own time. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Being able to take a step back and really understand the problem that we are trying to solve with 
                                what we are creating is really important. Currently in my self learning journey I have worked the main 
                                front end technologies such as html, css, and javascript. My backend experience is solely based in SQL 
                                at the moment. I do have experience querying an Oracle Database which is with html, css, javascript, and sql.
                                At my current job we use SQL to query an Oracle database quite regularly. Its always a good feeling when you 
                                create a query that retrieves and organizes your data efficiently. I enjoy figuring out how to solve problems
                                and learning something new which is what gets me excited about working in the software industry
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My favorite things to do in my spare time is yoga, gardening, creating
                                beaded jewelry, traveling and spending time with my friends and family
                            </p>
